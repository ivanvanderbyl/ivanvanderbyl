### Hi there 👋

I'm Ivan, and I love building products. 

I've been building software on the web for 15 years professionally (and a few years before that in High School). I started out with PHP (<2006), then Ruby On Rails (2007), and NodeJS around 2014. At a [RailsCamp](https://rails.camp/) in New Zealand in 2012 [Josh Kalderimis](https://github.com/joshk) taught me Go, and I did that for a while at DigitalOcean. 

At the end of 2014 I met [Tim Koopmans](https://github.com/timkoopmans) at another RailsCamp in Perth, Australia, and along with Mikel Lindsaar we founded Flood IO, a load testing as a service company. It did pretty well, and Tricentis acquired us 3 years later. While at Tricentis I transitioned from Software Architect to senior director of Product Management, and got to build amazing products in a fully-remote team stretching Australia, Austria, Netherlands, USA, and Mexico.

Unfortunately, due to world events, managing a team remotely during 2020/21 era with endless zoom meetings at midnight 3 days a week wasn't enjoyable to say the least, so I left to found Airheart with my fiancé [@LindseyRenken](https://github.com/LindseyRenken). 

At Airheart, we believe travel software has lacked real innovation for a long time and is often clunky and slow, and doesn't work when you land in a new country without internet. To avoid being that, we're early adopters of Svelte, and we built our backend in Go, using Ent and GraphQL.

If this sounds like your ideal wheelhouse, lets talk, 📫 Email me: my first name at my website: [ivan.dev](https://ivan.dev)

**TL;DR**
- 🔭 Currently I'm to Co-founder and CPO at [Airheart](https://airheart.com) where we're building a new kind of travel experience for frequent travelers. Previously I was a Product Manager at Tricentis, focusing on building performance testing software for modern web apps. I joined Tricentis through the acquisition of my last company, [Flood IO](github.com/flood-io).
- 🌱 In my spare time if I'm not coding I'm travelling, ~~Heliskiing~~ 🏂 Heli-snowboarding in NZ, running, or doing Cross Fit training.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on building the future of travel tech.
