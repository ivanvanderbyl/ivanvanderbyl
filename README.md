### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ivan, and I love building products. 

- ðŸ”­ Currently I'm to Co-founder and CPO at [Airheart](https://airheart.com) where we're building a new kind of travel experience for frequent travelers. Previously I was a Product Manager at Tricentis, focusing on building performance testing software for modern web apps. I joined Tricentis through the acquisition of my last company, [Flood IO](github.com/flood-io).
- ðŸŒ± In my spare time I love coding in #Go and #Next.js with a bit of Tailwind for good measure.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on anything related to automation, devops, or product management.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [Flood Element](https://github.com/flood-io/element) â€” our browser based load testing tool.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [@ivanderbyl](https://twitter.com/ivanderbyl) on Twitter or @i2n on Clubhouse. My personal website: [ivan.dev](https://ivan.dev)
